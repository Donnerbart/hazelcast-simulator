/**
 * The {@link AfterWarmup} annotation can be placed on a method to trigger that it should reset any global state after
 * the warmup has completed.
 *
 * The {@link AfterWarmup} is used for the sake of warmup in combination with {@link TimeStep} based test. When a warmup duration
 * is defined, the timestep methods will be called in exactly the same way as during the actual run phase. Once the warmup
 * period has completed, the runner threads and their thread-state are discarded and new ones will be created for the run period.
 *
 * However it could be that some global state was modified during the warmup phase that needs to be reset. This global state
 * is reset by methods with the {@link AfterWarmup} annotation. This is done between the warmup and the run phase.
 *
 * If no warmup duration is defined, the {@link AfterWarmup} method is not called.
 *
 * Multiple {@link AfterWarmup} methods are allowed. The {@link AfterWarmup} methods on a subclass are executed before
 * the {@link AfterWarmup} methods on a super class, however there is no ordering within the same class. This is the same
 * semantics as provided by junit. Local {@link AfterWarmup} always happens before global {@link AfterWarmup}.
